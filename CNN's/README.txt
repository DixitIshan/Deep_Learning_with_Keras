1) All the examples are performed with different datasets such as:
--> Mnist
--> CIFAR10
--> Fashion-Mnist
--> CIFAR100

2) Dataset for the example of dog vs cat can be found @ https://sds-platform-private.s3-us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/14_page_p8s40_file_1.zip

3)You can tinker around with the things like:
--> number of convolutional layers
--> number of filters used in convolutional layer
--> number of fully connected dense layers
--> number of nodes in fully connected dense layers
--> number of pooling layers
--> number of epochs
--> number of batch size
--> changing the optimizers
--> changing the pooling function from "MaxPooling2D" to "MinPooling2D", "AveragePooling2D" etc.
--> combination of activation functions of different layers
--> callback monitoring

4) The examples here use Tensorflow as backend for the Keras API
