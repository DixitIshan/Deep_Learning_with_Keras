# A Primer on ANN's:

Inspired by the __Biological Neuron__, this __novel Mathematical Architecture__ is at the core of Deep Learning.

__An artificial neuron is a mathematical function representing a model of a biological neuron__. A very simple ANN is shown below. It contains one input layer of 3 input nodes, 2 hidden layers with 4 nodes each and an output node.

1. All the examples are performed with various datasets:

2. The examples here use Tensorflow as backend for the Keras API

3. You can tinker around with the things like:

    1. number of fully connected dense layers

    2. number of nodes in fully connected dense layers

    3. number of epochs

    4. number of batch size

    5. changing the optimizers

    6. combination of activation functions of different layers

    7. callback monitoring

4. Reference:
