# A Primer on ANN's:

Inspired by the Biological Neurons, this novel Mathematical Architecture is at the core of Deep Learning.

1. All the examples are performed with various datasets:

2. The examples here use Tensorflow as backend for the Keras API

3. You can tinker around with the things like:

    1. number of fully connected dense layers

    2. number of nodes in fully connected dense layers

    3. number of epochs

    4. number of batch size

    5. changing the optimizers

    6. combination of activation functions of different layers

    7. callback monitoring
